==========

Hashing.  It's one of _the fundamentals_ of Computer Science, but
how do you compare the **performance** of a given hash function to
another?

Here, you will find my attempts at solving that problem for
multiple personal projects.  I'm not (currently) in the business
of defining new hashing algorithms, so it just focuses on hash
functions built by smarter people than me, and attempts to portray
their behavior and performance characteristics.

Above all, this _test suite_ strives to be flexible, enabling new
tests corpora to be integrated with minimal effort.

I hope you find this useful.
